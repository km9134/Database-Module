# Database-Module
Flight booking system as per requirements of Database module year 2 MSc program

Assignment Summary:
Students will undertake the design and implementation of a database system for a commercial airline booking system (Easyjet.com). Their database system will mirror the operation of selected aspects of the real airline booking system. Students will be expected to individually create the database tables, populate them with some sample data and write SQL queries to demonstrate their database.

Written report and demo video = 100% of module score.
Individual Written Report:
You should produce a report detailing and justifying your chosen database design. The report has a page limit of 10 pages. I am much more interested in a shorter well- thought-out submission, rather than lots of waffle.
While you may have designed the database as a group, I am interested in your justifications for the design decisions made. For instance, if you don’t agree with your group’s database design, then you should highlight the problem areas and propose sensible improvements.
The content of the report is up to you, however, as a guide, you should consider including at least the following:
• An overview of the database design ERD. It might be helpful to include at least your initial and final design (if you wish to include more diagrams you may include these in the appendix which will not be counted as part of the page limit);
• A list of any reasonable design assumptions you have made;
• An explanation of some of the primary keys, foreign key constraints between tables and the data types used in your database;
• A discussion and justification for some of the important design decisions you made;
• A discussion and justification for some of the important normalisation decisions you made;
• A discussion and justification for some improvements you might make to the design;
• Evidence of your SQL queries (these can simply be pasted into the appendix). The
report is essentially a wider extension of the work you need to compete for your video demo. You are welcome to re-use content prepared for your individual video demo.
A video outlining the expected content and structure of your written report (in addition to the guidance provided above) will be provided on Canvas during the semester.
Individual Demonstration Video:
You should produce a screen recording (max duration of 10 mins) with audio commentary which will allow you to demonstrate your implemented database.
It may help you to decide on a narrative for the video, but don’t feel you have to script every word. You should, however, pre-write your SQL queries before recording the video, so that you don’t have to spend time writing them during the screen recording.
A video outlining the expected content and structure of your demonstration video will be provided on Canvas during the semester.
